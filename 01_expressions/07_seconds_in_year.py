# Problem Statement
# Use Python to calculate the number of seconds in a year, and tell the user what the result is in a nice print statement that looks like this (of course the value 5 should be the calculated number instead):

# There are 5 seconds in a year!

# You should use constants for this exercise -- there are 365 days in a year, 24 hours in a day, 60 minutes in an hour, and 60 seconds per minute.

# ⏰ Constants
DAYS_IN_YEAR = 365
HOURS_IN_DAY = 24
MINUTES_IN_HOUR = 60
SECONDS_IN_MINUTE = 60

# 🔢 Calculate total seconds in a year
seconds_in_year = DAYS_IN_YEAR * HOURS_IN_DAY * MINUTES_IN_HOUR * SECONDS_IN_MINUTE

# 🖨️ Print the result in a friendly way
print(f"There are {seconds_in_year} seconds in a year! 🎉")
