# Problem Statement
# Fill out the get_name() function to return your name as a string! We've written a main() function for you which calls your function to retrieve your name and then prints it in a greeting.

# Here's a sample run of the program where the name we've decided to return is Sophia (the autograder expects the returned name to be Sophia):

# Howdy Sophia ! ðŸ¤ 


def get_name():
    return "Rimsha"  # Return your name as string

def main():
    name = get_name()  # Get name from function
    print("Howdy", name, "! ðŸ¤ ")  # Print greeting

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
